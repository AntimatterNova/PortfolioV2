                Hello there stranger! My name is Darien Valet. From a young age, I was interested in computers. Primarily playing games, but also making basic text based adventure games using a language called batch. That that hobby slowly evolved into an interest in programming in general. I've played around with many different things. From the simple batch games of my early life, to playing around with the Unity game engine, to going through a full-stack bootcamp through Kansas University. I also have some entry level skills in graphical design. Though not formally trained in it, I have always been told that I have an artistic eye. That is hopefully evident in the layout and color of this portfolio website.
